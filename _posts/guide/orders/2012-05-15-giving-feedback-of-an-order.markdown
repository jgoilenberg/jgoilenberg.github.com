#Feedback API

##Overview
After completing a sale and a purchase, according to MercadoLibre’s rules, each part has to provide feedback about the transaction (an order).
This feedback says if the order was fulfilled and the seller and buyer rate each others respectively.
Seller’s and buyer’s score on MercadoLibre platform is calculated based on these ratings.

##POST feedback (buyer) {#post-feedback-buyer}
Suppose the product size is not what the buyer wanted, thus he rates negative the transaction.

{% highlight javascript %}
{"rating":"NEGATIVE","fulfilled":false,"reason": "DESCRIPTION_DIDNT_MATCH_ARTICLE","message":"The product is not what I expected. It is too small."}

https://api.mercadolibre.com/orders/ORDER_ID/feedback/
{% endhighlight %}



##Reply a feedback {#reply-feedback}

You can give a reply on the feedback that the other part gave to you, to explain your reasons.

{% highlight javascript %}
https://api.mercadolibre.com/orders/<ORDER_ID>/feedback/<EXPERIENCE>
{% endhighlight %}

###Experience can be: **sale** or **purchase**, depending if you are selling or buying, respectively.

As a seller you can send a POST request like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
{"reply": "The size was detailed in the description, however if you send it back we can refund you the money." }

https://api.mercadolibre.com/orders/ORDER_ID/feedback/sale
{% endhighlight %}



##Changing a feedback {#change-feedback}

You can change a feedback because you change your mind.
Example: Upon receiving the money back from the seller you decide to change a negative feedback to neutral.

A buyer would send a PUT request like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
{
"rating":"NEUTRAL","fulfilled":false,"message":"I received the money back"
}

https://api.mercadolibre.com/orders/ORDER_ID/feedback/purchase
{% endhighlight %}
