#Validate Item before posting
You can verify if you listing would be OK before sending a real POST to the Items API. The Items API provide a validation service to check you listing details before publishing it. It’s very useful to practice and check attributes variations!

To verify your listing POST using the validation service, execute the following API call:

<pre class="terminal">
curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d
'{
"title": "Test Item - Do Not Bid",
"category_id": "MLA3530",
"price": 10,
"currency_id": "ARS",
"available_quantity": 1,
"listing_type_id": "bronze",
"condition":"new"
}'


https://api.mercadolibre.com/items/validate?access_token=$ACCESS_TOKEN
</pre>
You will receive a “HTTP/1.1 204 No Content” message from the Items API if the listing POST example would pass the Items API validation process. To see the “HTTP/1.1 204 No Content” message on screen add the -i parameter to the curl command.
